# What is Tracardi

Tracardi is a system that supports customer engagement and enhances the consumer experience. Tracardi is not a marketing automation system, although it does have some elements to support customer decision-making. Tracardi is intended for anyone who carries out some type of customer interaction, be it through sales or service delivery.

# How tracardi performs its services

Trcardi collects data from the so-called customer journeys. The data is in the form of events that have context and event data. Each event is assigned a profile that is maintained throughout the period of interaction with the client, incl. using a website or mobile application.

Customer journey data is aggregated in the profile. The method of attaching data to the profile is defined in the graphical editor, which is part of the Tracardi system.


Customer data is aggregated in the profile. The method of attaching data to the profile is defined in the graphical editor, which is part of the Tracardi system.

By integrating the system with, among others saas service, you can use the system to track each customer's interaction with the company. The scope may cover various consumer decisions, including

* If the customer decides to subscribe to your services;
* Under what circumstances (the so-called event context);
* Whether the customer is satisfied with your service or wants to cancel it;

# Data processing and decision making

The scope of data processing depends on what the administrator creates in the graphical data editor. Tracardi can connect to other systems, such as AI, to analyze, for example, whether a customer who left a product description is satisfied with it or not (sentiment analysis).
In this way, the controller decides how the data is processed and whether we need to contact the customer or provide any information in the end user interface.

# Interaction with customers

Contact with the client depends on the consents granted. Tracardi stores the consent for direct contact and, depending on the consent granted, you can, for example, send the customer a confirmation of the transaction by e-mail or, for example, only display it on the website.

Tracardi can support increased customer engagement by, for example, asking questions about transaction satisfaction, etc. For this purpose, Tracardi uses micro applications (micro frontends) that can be conditionally attached to a regular website, depending on what has been defined in the workflow editor.
These types of applications appear as pop-ups on the website and can send subsequent events to the system.

Tracardi also integrates other contact methods, such as sending SMS notifications, e-mails or contact via external systems.
