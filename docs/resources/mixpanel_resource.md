# Resource configuration and set-up

In order to enable an integration between Mixpanel and Tracardi you need an API. Mixpanel has developed a number of APIs
for clients to use that provide a substantial amount of added functionality and give clients the means to customize data
analysis. Mixpanel uses Project tokens for API authentication, it is an identification sent along with each piece of
data you send to your project.

To view the Project token:

1. In the Mixpanel header bar, click the __icon with your initials__.
2. Under __"PERSONAL SETTINGS"__, click __Profile & Preferences__.
3. Click __Project__ in the left navigation bar.
4. In __"Projects"__, you see each project in the organization. Each project contains values for its __token__, __API
   key__, and __API secret__.
